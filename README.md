Python Battery Mathematical Modelling solves continuum models for batteries, using both numerical methods and asymptotic analysis.

## How do I use PyBaMM?

PyBaMM comes with a number of [detailed examples](examples/README.md), hosted here on github. In addition, there is a [full API documentation](http://pybamm.readthedocs.io/), hosted on [Read The Docs](readthedocs.io).

## How can I install PyBaMM?

The safest way to install PyBaMM is to do so within a virtual environment ([introduction to virtual environments](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/))

You'll need the following requirements:

- Python 3.5+
- Python libraries: `numpy` `scipy` `pandas` `matplotlib`

These can easily be installed using `pip`. To do this, first make sure you have the latest version of pip installed:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

Then navigate to the path where you downloaded PyBaMM to, and install both PyBaMM and its dependencies by typing:

```bash
pip install .
```

Or, if you want to install PyBaMM as a [developer](CONTRIBUTING.md), use

```bash
pip install -e .[dev,docs]
```

To uninstall again, type

```bash
pip uninstall pybamm
```

## Optional dependencies

### [scikits.odes](https://github.com/bmcage/odes)

Users can install [scikits.odes](https://github.com/bmcage/odes) in order to use the
wrapped SUNDIALS ODE and DAE
[solvers](https://pybamm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/solvers/scikits_solvers.html).

To install scikits.odes, you will need to first download and compile sundials 3.1.1. On
the command-line type:

```bash
INSTALL_DIR=`pwd`/sundials
wget https://computation.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/download/sundials-3.1.1.tar.gz
tar -xvf sundials-3.1.1.tar.gz
mkdir build-sundials-3.1.1
cd build-sundials-3.1.1/
cmake -DLAPACK_ENABLE=ON -DSUNDIALS_INDEX_TYPE=int32_t -DBUILD_ARKODE:BOOL=OFF -DEXAMPLES_ENABLE:BOOL=OFF -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$INSTALL_DIR ../sundials-3.1.1/
make install
rm -r sundials-3.1.1
```

Then install [scikits.odes](https://github.com/bmcage/odes), letting it know the sundials install location:

```bash
SUNDIALS_INST=$INSTALL_DIR pip install scikits.odes
```

After this, you will need to set your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point to the sundials
library:

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$INSTALL_DIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

You may wish to put this last line in your `.bashrc` or virtualenv `activate` script,
which will save you needing to set your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` every time you log in. For
example, to add this line to your `.bashrc` you can type:

```bash
echo "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$INSTALL_DIR/lib:\$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
```

Please see the [scikits.odes
documentation](https://scikits-odes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) for more
detailed installation instructions.
