    "# Compare particle diffusion models\n",
    "In this notebook we compare the different models for mass transport within the electrode particles. For a full list of all the particle models, see the [documentation](https://docs.pybamm.org/en/latest/source/api/models/submodels/particle/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "With the \"Fickian diffusion\" option a diffusion equation is solved within the particle domain, with the boundary flux prescribed at the surface related to the local current density. Alternatively, one can assume a particular (polynomial) concentration profile within the particle (at present, this can be uniform, quadratic, or quartic). The \"uniform profile\" model assumes that the concentration inside the particle is uniform in space (and therefore equal to the surface concentration through the entire particle - in effect ignoring transport resistance within the particle), and solves an ODE for the average particle concentration. The \"quadratic profile\" model additionally solves an algebraic equation for the surface concentration, taking into account the effect of diffusion within the particle. Finally, the \"quartic profile\" model also solves for the average concentration gradient (the integral of $\\partial c/ \\partial r$) in the particle, giving a higher-order approximation to the concentration profile within the particle.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the exchange current density is a function of surface concentration, we can see the effect the choice of particle model has on the voltage profile arising from different overpotentials."
