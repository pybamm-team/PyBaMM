    "The Many Paticle Model (MPM) of a lithium-ion battery is an extension of the Single Particle Model to account for a continuous distribution of active particle sizes in each electrode $\\text{k}=\\text{n},\\text{p}$. Therefore, many of the same model assumptions hold, e.g., the transport in the electrolyte is instantaneous and hence the through-cell variation (in $x$) is neglected. The full set of assumptions and description of the particle size geometry is given in [[4]](#References). Note that the MPM in [[4]](#References) is for a half cell and the version implemented in PyBaMM is for a full cell and uses the notation and scaling given in [[5]](#References).\n",
