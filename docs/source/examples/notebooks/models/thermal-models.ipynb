        "There are a number of thermal submodels available in PyBaMM. In this notebook we give details of each of the models, and highlight any relevant parameters. At present PyBaMM includes an isothermal and a lumped thermal model, both of which can be used with any cell geometry, as well as a 1D thermal model which accounts for the through-cell variation in temperature in a pouch cell, and \"1+1D\" and \"2+1D\" pouch cell models which assumed the temperature is uniform through the thickness of the pouch, but accounts for variations in temperature in the remaining dimensions. Here we give the governing equations for each model (except the isothermal model, which just sets the temperature to be equal to to the parameter \"Ambient temperature [K]\"). \n",
