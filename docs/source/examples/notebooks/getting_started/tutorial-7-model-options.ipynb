    "In all of the previous tutorials, we have made use of the default forms of the inbuilt models in PyBaMM. However, PyBaMM provides a high-level interface for tweaking these models for your particular application. The core idea is that additional physics can be added to your electrochemical model of choice. These additional models can be specified via the model options (for a full list of options see the [documentation](https://docs.pybamm.org/en/latest/source/api/models/base_models/base_battery_model.html#pybamm.BatteryModelOptions))."

From the [documentation](https://docs.pybamm.org/en/latest/source/api/models/base_models/base_battery_model.html), we see that we have a choice of various thermal models. For a deeper look at the thermal models see the [thermal models notebook](../models/thermal-models.ipynb). We choose the lumped thermal model, which solves the spatially-dependent heat equation on our battery geometry, and couples the temperature with the electrochemistry. We set the model options by creating a Python dictionary:"
