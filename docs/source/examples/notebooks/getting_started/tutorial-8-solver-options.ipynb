    "# Tutorial 8 - Solver options\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Tutorial 7](./tutorial-7-model-options.ipynb) we saw how to change the model options. In this tutorial we will show how to modify the solver options. All models in PyBaMM have a default solver which is typically different depending on whether the discretised model results in a system of algebraic equations, ordinary differential equations (ODEs) or differential algebraic equations (DAEs). \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common options one might want to change is the solver tolerances. By default all tolerances are set to $10^{-6}$. However, depending on your simulation, you may find you want to tighten the tolerances to obtain a more accurate solution, or you may want to loosen the tolerances to reduce the solve time. It is good practice to conduct a tolerance study, where you simulate the same problem with a tighter tolerances and compare the results. We do not show how to do this here, but we give an example of a mesh resolution study in the [next tutorial](./tutorial-9-changing-the-mesh.ipynb), which is conducted in a similar way."

    "\n",
    "The `CasadiSolver` can operate in a number of modes, including \"safe\" (default) and \"fast\". The main difference between these modes is how events are handled. Safe mode performs step-and-check integration and supports event handling (e.g. you can integrate until you hit a certain voltage), and is the recommended for simulations of a full charge or discharge. Fast mode performs direct integration, ignoring events, and is recommended when simulating a drive cycle or other simulation where no events are triggered.\n",

For both simulations we'll use $10^{-3}$ for both the absolute and relative tolerance. For demonstration purposes we change the cut-off voltage to 3.6V so we can observe the different behaviour of the two solver modes."
