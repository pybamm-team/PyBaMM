    "We start defining an experiment, which consists on a set of instructions on how to cycle the battery. These instructions can be defined in two different ways, but the simplest is to use strings. The instructions can be of the form `\"(Dis)charge at x A/C/W\"`, `\"Rest\"`, or `\"Hold at x V\"`. The instructions can also include how long each step should run for. The duration is introduced by the word `\"for\"` followed by the duration, e.g. `\"for 10 seconds\"`, `\"for 3 minutes\"` or `\"for 1 hour\"`. Terminating conditions can also be specified. In this case, the step will stop when that condition is met. These conditions should be a circuit state and are introduced by the word `\"until\"`, e.g. `\"until 1 A\"`, `\"until C/50\"` or `\"until 3 V\"`. Duration and termination conditions can be combined using the word `\"or\"` and the step will either finish when the condition is met or after the specified duration (whichever happens first).\n",

    "In order to reproduce real cycling conditions, often the experiments will be composed of several \"cycles\", where a cycle is a user-defined collection of steps. In PyBaMM, we can define a cycle as a tuple of steps, which means that we can process the solution in terms of cycles. For more information on this functionality, please see the [long experiments notebook](../simulations_and_experiments/simulating-long-experiments.ipynb). We can also leverage the list addition and multiplication operators to combine and repeat cycles. For example, if we want a three cycles of constant current C/10 discharge, a one hour rest, a constant current (1 A) constant voltage (4.1 V) and another one hour rest, followed by a cycle of 1C discharge we can write:\n"
