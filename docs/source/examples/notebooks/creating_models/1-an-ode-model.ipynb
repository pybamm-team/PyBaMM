In PyBaMM a model can be defined using the [`pybamm.BaseModel`](https://docs.pybamm.org/en/stable/source/api/models/base_models/base_model.html) class. PyBaMM models can be composed by differential and/or algebraic equations. Differential equations have the form $\\frac{\\mathrm{d} x}{\\mathrm{d} t} = f(x, y, t)$, where $x$ and $y$ are state variables, $t$ is time, and $f(x, y, t)$ is an arbitrary function that will refer as the right-hand-side (rhs) of the differential equation. Algebraic equations have the form $g(x, y, t) = 0$. For example, let's consider the following arbitrary system:\n",

    "$$\n",

    "2. `algebraic` - a Python dictionary of the algebraic equations. The key is still a state variable (just for indexing purposes, e.g $y$) and the value is the function that is equal to zero (e.g. $g(x, y, t)$). For our example, we would write `{y: g(x, y, t)}`. It is worth reiterating that this imposes $g(x, y, t) = 0$, not $y = g(x, y, t)$.\n",
    "3. `initial_conditions` - a Python dictionary of the initial conditions. Again, the key is the variable we are imposing an initial condition for and the value is the initial value. Even though mathematically initial conditions are only needed for differential equations, PyBaMM also requires them for algebraic equations and the value is used as an initial guess for the solver. For our example, we would write `{x: x_0, y: y_0}` (where `y_0` would be a reasonable value for y at the initial state).\n",
    "4. `variables` - a Python dictionary of the output variables. The key is a string with the variable name (as a string) and the value is the expression for that variable. For our example, we would write `{\"z\": h(x, y, t)}`.\n",
