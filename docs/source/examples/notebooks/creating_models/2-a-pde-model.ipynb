    "# 2. Creating a simple PDE model - Single Particle Model for a half cell\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [previous notebook](./1-an-ode-model.ipynb) we showed how to create and solve an ODE model in PyBaMM. In this notebook we show how to create and solve a partial differential equation (PDE) model. PDE models are more complex than ODEs as they include derivatives with respect two different variables (in our problems these will be a spatial variable and a time variable). Additional steps will be required to solve PDE models, like discretising the spatial domain.\n",

The model also has the open-circuit potential $U_\\mathrm{p}$ and applied current density $i(t)$ (i.e. the applied current divided by the current collector area) as function parameters, and the Faraday constant $F$ and the universal gas constant $R$.

    "## Using the model\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the model is now completely defined, we can proceed to solve it. In the previous notebook, we had an ODE model so we could proceed to solve it directly. But now we have a PDE model, so we need to take some additional steps. To handle PDEs, PyBaMM uses the [method of lines](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Method_of_lines). In a nutshell, this method consists in replacing the continuous spatial operators with a discrete version (a step known as discretisation), which yields the discretised model. Then, the discretised model is integrated in time as we did with the ODE model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discretising a PDE means transforming it from a continuous form, which involves variables that can change smoothly, into a discrete form, which involves variables that change in distinct steps or intervals. This process converts the continuous problem, which is typically defined over a continuous domain, into a set of algebraic equations that can be solved using numerical methods. Essentially, discretisation breaks down the PDE into a finite number of simpler equations that approximate the solution at specific points in the domain. This makes it possible to find the solution at these set points using computational techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "To discretise a PDE we need to define a mesh and a spatial method. The mesh defines the number and position of points at which we want to compute the solution. The spatial method defines how we approximate the spatial operators (e.g. divergence, gradients...) with a discrete counterpart.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining a geometry\n",
    "But before discretising, we need to specify the geometry, as the model above is geometry agnostic. First, we need to define the spatial variables in a similar way to how we defined the other model variables.
