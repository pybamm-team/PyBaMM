    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will discuss the use of interpolation and evaluation points in PyBaMM. These points are used to control the solver and the output of the simulation, and can be used to improve the performance of the solver, or if they are used incorrectly, can lead to decreased performance.\n",

    "## Solver timestepping\n",
    "\n",
    "Every PyBaMM solver solves the equations by starting from a set of initial conditions and then \"stepping\" forward in time by a small amount of time. At each step, the solver solves the equations, including any algebraic conditions, and evaluates the local error to determine how long each time-step should be in order to satisfy the tolerances supplied by the user. Therefore, the progress of the solver is defined by a sequence of internal time-points at which the solver solved the equations. For example if we wanted to solve the equations from t=0 to t=10s, the solver might choose to solve the equations at the following time-points:\n",

In our example above the solution would consist of $n=7$ solutions. This data can be later used to either plot the solution, or to evaluate any output variables that the user has requested. \n",

    "Thus far, we have described how the solver chooses its own internal timepoints in order to solve the equations at. In some cases, however, these timepoints need to be supplied by the user to ensure an accurate solution. A trivial example of this is the start and end timepoints that you wish to perform the solve. Other points include the points at which the solution is discontinuous, which the solver cannot know in advance or detect. For this reason PyBaMM also allows the user to supply a set of evaluation points to the solver using the [`t_eval`](https://docs.pybamm.org/en/stable/source/api/solvers/base_solver.html#pybamm.BaseSolver.solve) argument to the `solve` function. The solver will then make sure to stop at each evaluation point and return the solution at these points. For example, say if `t_eval = [0, 5, 10]`, the solution returned by the solver might be:\n",

    "Normally, a PyBaMM user would not be required to supply any evaluation points other than the start and end points of the simulation. PyBaMM itself detects any discontinuous events in the model and adds these to the evaluation points before passing them to the solver. However, in some cases the user may know in advance that the solution is discontinuous at a certain point, and it is more accurate and numerically stable to supply this point to the solver. Note, however, that every additional evaluation point will increase the time taken to solve the equations as the solver will be reqired to take more steps to solve the equations, so only add additional evaluation points if required.\n",

    "When evaluating output variables using this solution, if no interpolation points are provided PyBaMM will interpolate between the internal time-points to get the solution at the time-points requested by the user. For example, if the user requested the solution at $t=0.1s$, PyBaMM would interpolate the solution between $t=0$ and $t=0.9$ to get the solution at $t=0.1s$. However, often a user will know in advance the time-points at which they want to evaluate the solution, and it is more efficient to simply provide these time-points to the solver in advance so that it can do this interpolation during the solve. \n",

The solver will then interpolate the solution on-the-fly during the solve, and return the solution at the requested time-points. For example, say if `t_interp = [2, 4, 6, 8]`, and the solver takes the same internal time-points as in the example above, the solution returned by the solver would be:\n",

Therefore, only use interpolation points if you know in advance the time-points at which you want to evaluate the solution, as interpolating to any other time-point post-solve will be much less accurate.\n"

In this case, providing interpolation points to the solver will be more efficient than storing all the internal time-points and then interpolating the solution post-solve. "
