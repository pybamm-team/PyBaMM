    "During a solve, the PyBaMM solver needs to store the solution vector $\\mathbf{y}$ at each time step. By default, PyBaMM stores the entire vector, so if the state vector is of size $n$ and the solver steps through $m$ time points, the memory usage is $O(nm)$. This can be a problem for large models, especially when running on a machine with limited memory, or when running a very long-running simulation that needs to store many time points.\n",

    "However, it is likely that the user is only interested in a small subset of the variables, and that the size of these output variables $\\mathbf{g}$ is much smaller than the size of the state vector $\\mathbf{y}$. Therefore, it could be wasteful to store the entire state vector $\\mathbf{y}$.\n",
    "To address this, PyBaMM has a feature called \"output variables\". This allows the user to specify a list of variables that they are interested in up front (i.e. before the solve). During the solve, PyBaMM will evaluate the output variables of interest at each time point and discard the rest of the state vector. At the end of the solve, the `pybamm.Solution` object will only contain the output variables of interest, as well as the full state vector at the last time point (so that other simulations can be run from this point).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how this works in practice. We'll start by solving a DFN model with a long-running experimental protocol, and assume we are only interested in the terminal voltage. We setup a PyBaMM simulation as normal and solve it, and once the solver has finished we extract the terminal voltage from the solution object. To evaluate the memory usage of this simulation, we will use the `tracemalloc` library, which allows us to track the total amount of memory allocated by the Python interpreter. We'll also keep track of the time taken to solve the model using the `time` library. "
