Input parameters are a special type of parameter that is *not* replaced by a value during step 1 of the pipeline, and can be used to replace many of the parameters in the model (as we'll see later this does not apply to some geometric parameters). \n",

We do this even though most of the structure of the model, and in particular the numerical discretisations of the spatial gradients, is unchanged.
