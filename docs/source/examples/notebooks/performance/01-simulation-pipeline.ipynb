    "## The PyBaMM Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "The PyBaMM pipeline is a series of steps that are taken to go from a model to a final solution. \n",
    "At the start of the pipeline, a pybamm model consists of a set of equations make up of symbols arranged in an [expression tree](https://docs.pybamm.org/en/stable/source/examples/notebooks/expression_tree/expression-tree.html). Each symbol could be a parameter (`pybamm.Parameter`), a variable (`pybamm.Variable`), a binary operator (`pybamm.Addition`, `pybamm.Multiplication`, etc.), or a unary operator (`pybamm.Negate`, `pybamm.Gradient`). You can see all the possible symbols in the API docs [here](https://docs.pybamm.org/en/stable/source/api/expression_tree/index.html). The pipeline is a series of steps that first transforms this expression tree into a form that can be solved by a numerical solver, and then solves the equations to get the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parameter replacement** - The first step of the pipeline is performed by the [`pybamm.ParameterValues`](https://docs.pybamm.org/en/stable/source/api/parameters/parameter_values.html#pybamm.ParameterValues) class, which (a) replaces all `pybamm.Parameter` symbols with their corresponding values (e.g. using `pybamm.Scalar`), and (b) replaces all `pybamm.FunctionParameter` symbols with either a `pybamm.Scalar`, `pybamm.Interpolant`, or `pybamm.Function` object. \n",
    "2. **Discretisation** - The next step is to discretise the model equations. This is done by the [`pybamm.Discretisation`](https://docs.pybamm.org/en/stable/source/api/spatial_methods/discretisation.html) class, which replaces all the symbols representing spatial derivatives (e.g. `pybamm.Gradient`) with a matrix that can be used to solve the equations numerically.\n",
    "3. **Solver setup** - The next step is to set up the numerical solver. This is done by the [`pybamm.BaseSolver`](https://docs.pybamm.org/en/stable/source/api/solvers/base_solver.html#pybamm.BaseSolver) class, which transforms the expression trees into a form that can be evaluated by the numerical solver. PyBaMM has a few different forms that can be used, but generally, this means that each expression tree is transformed into a CasADi function that can be evaluated at a given time and state.\n",
    "4. **Solver solve** - The next step is to solve the equations. This is done by the numerical solver, which in most cases is one of the solvers provided by the [Sundials](https://sundials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) suite of solvers. The solver takes the CasADi functions generated in the previous step and uses them to solve the equations numerically.\n",
    "5. **Post-processing** - The output of the previous step is the solution to the equations at a set of time points. The final step is to post-process this solution to get the variables of interest. This is done by the [`pybamm.Solution`](https://docs.pybamm.org/en/stable/source/api/solvers/solution.html) and [`pybamm.ParameterValues`](https://docs.pybamm.org/en/stable/source/api/parameters/parameter_values.html#pybamm.ParameterValues) classes, which take the solution and the parameter values and return the variables of interest interpolated at the desired time points.\n",
    "\n",
    "For every simulation you run with PyBaMM, these steps are always performed in order to generate each solution, even if they are hidden from you by various convenience classes like [`pybamm.Simulation`](https://docs.pybamm.org/en/stable/source/api/simulation.html) . Understanding the pipeline is important because it can help you identify where the performance bottlenecks are in your simulations, and how you can optimise them to get the best performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a simple example that demonstrates the different parts of the pipeline, using the DFN model. While you probably have seen something similar to this script before, the one difference is that we have split the solver setup (step 3) and solve (step 4) parts of the pipeline into two separate steps. Often these are combined into the first call to the solver, but we have split them here to make it clear that they are separate steps."

    "From this output, we can see that the actual time taken to solve the equations is only a small percentage (less than 10%) of the total time taken to run the simulation. In fact, the most time-consuming step is the discretisation, which takes roughly 50% of the total time to discretise the spatial derivatives of the model. Even when this has all been done, the solver setup takes more than double the time of the actual solve. All of these numbers emphasises the fact that there is significant overhead in setting up the equations and the solver before the actual solution can be computed. Therefore, if you are looking to optimise the performance of your simulations, you should take care to ensure that you minimise the time spent in the setup steps of the pipeline, particularly if you are running many simulations with the same model and/or discretisation.\n",

    "The main takeaway from this is that the simulation object is a heavy object that caches many of the intermediate steps of the pipeline, so if you are running many simulations with the same model and discretisation, you should use the same simulation object to avoid the overhead of setting up the simulation each time. For the particular case of varying the parameters of the model, you can use input parameters to keep certain model parameters as symbols rather than concrete values during the 1st step of the pipeline, thus allowing you to re-use a particular discretisation and solver setup. This will be discussed in more depth in the next notebook."
