    "The simplest way to solve a model is to use the `Simulation` class. This automatically processes the model (setting of parameters, setting up the mesh and discretisation, etc.) for you, and provides built-in functionality for solving and plotting. Changing things such as parameters in handled by passing options to the `Simulation`, as shown in the [Getting Started](../getting_started/tutorial-1-how-to-run-a-model.ipynb) guides, [example notebooks](../../index.rst) and [documentation](https://docs.pybamm.org/en/latest/source/api/simulation.html).\n",
