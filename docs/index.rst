PyBaMM (Python Battery Mathematical Modelling) is an open-source battery simulation package
written in Python. Our mission is to accelerate battery modelling research by
providing open-source tools for multi-institutional, interdisciplinary collaboration.
Broadly, PyBaMM consists of

#. a framework for writing and solving systems of differential equations,
#. a library of battery models and parameters, and
#. specialized tools for simulating battery-specific experiments and visualizing the results.

Together, these enable flexible model definitions and fast battery simulations, allowing users to
explore the effect of different battery designs and modeling assumptions under a variety of operating scenarios.
