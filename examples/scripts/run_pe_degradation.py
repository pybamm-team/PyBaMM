This tutorial runs the core-shell model for phase transition caused PE
(NMC811) degradation, based on the paper
-- Mingzhao Zhuo, Gregory Offer, Monica Marinescu, "Degradation model of
   high-nickel positive electrodes: Effects of loss of active material and
   cyclable lithium on capacity fade", Journal of Power Sources,
   556 (2023): 232461. doi: 10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.232461.
The following scripts reproduce the results presented in Figs. 5, 7, 9 etc.
c_s: Trapped lithium concentration in the shell [mol.m-3]
rho: Positive electrode shell resistivity [Ohm.m]
Fig. 5: c_s = 14802, rho = 0
Fig. 7: c_s = 20000, rho = 0
Fig. 9: c_s = 20000, rho = 1e6
