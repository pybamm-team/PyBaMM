    "The SPM consists of two spherically symmetric diffusion equations: one within a representative negative particle ($k=\\text{n}$) and one within a representative positive particle ($k=\\text{p}$). In the centre of the particle the classical no-flux condition is imposed. Since the SPM assumes that all particles in an electrode behave in exactly the same way, the flux on the surface of a particle is simply the current divided by the thickness of the electrode. We shall use $r_k\\in[0,1]$ for the radial coordinate of the particle in electrode $k$. The concentration of lithium in electrode $k$ is denoted $c_k$ and the current is denoted by $\\mathcal{I}$. All parameters in the model stated here are dimensionless and are given in terms of dimensional parameters at the end of this notebook.The model equations for the SPM are then: \n",
