    "The SPM consists of two spherically symmetric diffusion equations: one within a representative negative particle ($\\text{k}=\\text{n}$) and one within a representative positive particle ($\\text{k}=\\text{p}$). In the centre of the particle the classical no-flux condition is imposed. Since the SPM assumes that all particles in an electrode behave in exactly the same way, the flux on the surface of a particle is simply the current $I$ divided by the thickness of the electrode $L_{\\text{k}}$. The concentration of lithium in electrode $\\text{k}$ is denoted $c_{\\text{k}}$ and the current is denoted by $I$. All parameters in the model stated here are dimensionless and are given in terms of dimensional parameters at the end of this notebook. The model equations for the SPM are then: \n",
