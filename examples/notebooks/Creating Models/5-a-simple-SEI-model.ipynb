    "The SEI is a porous layer that forms on the surfaces of negative electrode particles from the products of electrochemical reactions which consume lithium and electrolyte solvents. In the first few cycles of use, a lithium-ion battery loses a large amount of capacity; this is generally attributed to lithium being consumed to produce SEI. However, after a few cycles, the rate of capacity loss slows at a rate often (but not always) reported to scale with the square root of time. SEI growth is therefore often considered to be limited in some way by a diffusion process."
