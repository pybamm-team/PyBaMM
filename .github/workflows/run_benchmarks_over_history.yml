# GitHub actions workflow that runs the benchmark suite in benchmarks/
# from "commit_start" to "commit_end".  It pushes the results to the
# pybamm-bench repo and updates the display website.

# This workflow is meant to be triggered manually, see
# https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.0/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow
