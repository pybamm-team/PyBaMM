class BaseSubModel:
    """
    The base class for all submodels. All submodels inherit from this class and must
    only provide public methods which overwrite those in this base class. Any methods
    added to a submodel that do not overwrite those in this bass class are made
    private with the prefix '_', providing a consistent public interface for all
    submodels.

    Parameters
    ----------
    param: parameter class
        The model parameter symbols
    domain: str
        The domain of the submodel.
    reaction: dict
        A dictionary of the reactions occuring in the model.

    Attributes
    ----------
    param: parameter class
        The model parameter symbols
    rhs: dict
        A dictionary that maps expressions (variables) to expressions that represent
        the rhs
    algebraic: dict
        A dictionary that maps expressions (variables) to expressions that represent
        the algebraic equations. The algebraic expressions are assumed to equate
        to zero. Note that all the variables in the model must exist in the keys of
        `rhs` or `algebraic`.
    initial_conditions: dict
        A dictionary that maps expressions (variables) to expressions that represent
        the initial conditions for the state variables y. The initial conditions for
        algebraic variables are provided as initial guesses to a root finding algorithm
        that calculates consistent initial conditions.
    boundary_conditions: dict
        A dictionary that maps expressions (variables) to expressions that represent
        the boundary conditions
    variables: dict
        A dictionary that maps strings to expressions that represent
        the useful variables
    events: dict
        A dictionary of events that should cause the solver to terminate (e.g.
        concentration goes negative). The keys are strings and the values are
        symbols.

    def get_fundamental_variables(self):
        """
        A public method that creates and returns the variables in a submodel which can
        be created independent of other submodels. For example, the electrolyte
        concentration variables can be created independent of whether any other
        variables have been defined in the model. As a rule, if a variable can be
        created without variables from other submodels, then it should be placed in
        this method.

        Returns
        -------
        dict :
            The variables created by the submodel which are independent of variables in
            other submodels.

        A public method that creates and returns the variables in a submodel which
        require variables in other submodels to be set first. For example, the
        exchange current density requires the concentration in the electrolyte to
        be created before it can be created. If a variable can be created independent
        of other submodels then it should be created in 'get_fundamental_variables'
        instead of this method.

        Parameters
        ----------
        variables: dict
            The variables in the whole model.

        -------
