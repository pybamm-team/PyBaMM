class Experiment:
    """
    Base class for experimental conditions under which to run the model. In general, a
    list of operating conditions should be passed in. Each operating condition should
    be either a `pybamm.step.BaseStep` class, which can be created using one of the
    methods `pybamm.step.current`, `pybamm.step.c_rate`, `pybamm.step.voltage`
    , `pybamm.step.power`, `pybamm.step.resistance`, or
    `pybamm.step.string`, or a string, in which case the string is passed to
    `pybamm.step.string`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    operating_conditions : list[str]
        List of strings representing the operating conditions.
    period : str, optional
        Period (1/frequency) at which to record outputs. Default is 1 minute. Can be
        overwritten by individual operating conditions.
    temperature: float, optional
        The ambient air temperature in degrees Celsius at which to run the experiment.
        Default is None whereby the ambient temperature is taken from the parameter set.
        This value is overwritten if the temperature is specified in a step.
    termination : list[str], optional
        List of strings representing the conditions to terminate the experiment. Default is None.
        This is different from the termination for individual steps. Termination for
        individual steps is specified in the step itself, and the simulation moves to
        the next step when the termination condition is met
        (e.g. 2.5V discharge cut-off). Termination for the
        experiment as a whole is specified here, and the simulation stops when the
        termination condition is met (e.g. 80% capacity).
