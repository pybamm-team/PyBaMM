class Callback:
    """
    Base class for callbacks, for documenting callback methods.

    Callbacks are used to perform actions (e.g. logging, saving) at certain points in
    the simulation. Each callback method is named `on_<event>`, where `<event>`
    describes the point at which the callback is called. For example, the callback
    `on_experiment_start` is called at the start of an experiment simulation. In
    general, callbacks take a single argument, `logs`, which is a dictionary of
    information about the simulation. Each callback method should return `None`
    (the output of the method is ignored).

    **EXPERIMENTAL** - this class is experimental and the callback interface may
    change in future releases.
