class SpectralVolume(pybamm.FiniteVolume):
    """
    A class which implements the steps specific to the Spectral Volume
    discretisation. It is implemented in such a way that it is very
    similar to FiniteVolume; that comes at the cost that it is only
    compatible with the SpectralVolume1DSubMesh (which is a certain
    subdivision of any 1D mesh, so it shouldn't be a problem).

    For broadcast and mass_matrix, we follow the default behaviour from
    SpatialMethod. For spatial_variable,
    divergence, divergence_matrix, laplacian, integral,
    definite_integral_matrix, indefinite_integral,
    indefinite_integral_matrix, indefinite_integral_matrix_nodes,
    indefinite_integral_matrix_edges, delta_function
    we follow the behaviour from FiniteVolume. This is possible since
    the node values are integral averages with Spectral Volume, just
    as with Finite Volume. delta_function assigns the integral value
    to a CV instead of a SV this way, but that doesn't matter too much.
    Additional methods that are inherited by FiniteVolume which
    technically are not suitable for Spectral Volume are
    boundary_value_or_flux, process_binary_operators, concatenation,
    node_to_edge, edge_to_node and shift. While node_to_edge (as well as
    boundary_value_or_flux and process_binary_operators)
    could utilize the reconstruction approach of Spectral Volume, the
    inverse edge_to_node would still have to fall back to the Finite
    Volume behaviour. So these are simply inherited for consistency.
    boundary_value_or_flux might not benefit from the reconstruction
    approach at all, as it seems to only preprocess symbols.
