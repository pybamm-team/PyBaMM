# PyBaMM Governance

The following contains the formal governance structure of the PyBaMM
project. This document clarifies how decisions are made with respect
to community interactions, including the relationship between
open source development and work that may be funded by for-profit
and non-profit entities.

## Code of Conduct

The PyBaMM community strongly values inclusivity and diversity. Everyone
should treat others with the utmost respect. Everyone in the community
must adhere to the
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/blob/develop/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md) which
reflects the values of our community. Violations of the code should be
reported to members of the steering council, where the offenses will be
handled on a case-by-case basis.

# Governing Rules and Duties

## Steering Council

The Project has a Steering Council that consists of Project
Contributors who have produced contributions that are substantial in
quality and quantity, and sustained over at least one year. The role
of the Council is to provide active leadership for the Project in
making everyday decisions on technical and administrative issues,
through working with and taking input from the Community.

During the everyday project activities, Council Members participate in
all discussions, code review and other project activities as peers
with all other Contributors and the Community. In these everyday
activities, Council Members do not have any special power or privilege
through their membership on the Council. However, it is expected that
because of the quality and quantity of their contributions and their
expert knowledge of the Project Software and Services that Council
Members will provide useful guidance, both technical and in terms of
project direction, to potentially less experienced Contributors.

The Steering Council and its Members play a special role in certain
situations. In particular, the Council may:

- Make decisions about the overall scope, vision and direction of
  the project.
- Make decisions about strategic collaborations with other
  organizations or individuals.
- Make decisions about specific technical issues, features, bugs and
  pull requests. They are the primary mechanism of guiding the code
  review process and merging pull requests.
- Make decisions about the Services that are run by the Project and
  manage those Services for the benefit of the Project and Community.
- Make decisions when regular community discussion does not produce
  consensus on an issue in a reasonable time frame.

Steering Council decisions are taken by simple majority, with the
exception of changes to the Governance Documents which follow the
procedure in the section 'Changing the Governance Documents'.

### Steering Council membership

To become eligible for being a Steering Council Member, an individual
must be a Project Contributor who has produced contributions that are
substantial in quality and quantity, and sustained over at least one
year. Potential Council Members are nominated by existing Council
Members or by the Community and voted upon by the existing Council
after asking if the potential Member is interested and willing to
serve in that capacity.

When considering potential Members, the Council will look at
candidates with a comprehensive view of their contributions. This will
include but is not limited to code, code review, infrastructure work,
mailing list and chat participation, community help/building,
education and outreach, design work, etc. We deliberately do not
set arbitrary quantitative metrics to avoid encouraging behavior
that plays to the metrics rather than the project's overall well-being.
We want to encourage a diverse array of backgrounds, viewpoints and
talents in our team, which is why we explicitly do not define code as
the sole metric on which Council membership will be evaluated.

If a Council Member becomes inactive in the project for a period of
one year, they will be considered for removal from the Council. Before
removal, the inactive Member will be approached by another Council
member to ask if they plan on returning to active participation. If
not they will be removed immediately upon a Council vote. If they plan
on returning to active participation soon, they will be given a grace
period of one year. If they do not return to active participation
within that time period they will be removed by vote of the Council
without further grace period. All former Council members can be
considered for membership again at any time in the future, like any
other Project Contributor. Retired Council members will be listed on
the project website, acknowledging the period during which they were
active in the Council.

The Council reserves the right to eject current Members if they are
deemed to be actively harmful to the Project's well-being, and
attempts at communication and conflict resolution have failed.

## Fiscal Decisions

All fiscal decisions are made by the steering council to ensure any
funds are spent in a manner that furthers the mission of the Project.
Fiscal decisions require majority approval by acting steering council
members.

## Advisory Committee

The Project will consider setting up an Advisory Committee that works to ensure the long-term
well-being of the Project. The role of the Committee will be to advise the Steering Council.

## Conflict of interest

It is expected that Steering Council and Advisory Committee Members
will be employed at a wide range of companies, universities and non-profit
organizations. Because of this, it is possible that Members will have
conflicts of interest. Such conflicts of interest include, but are not
limited to:

- Financial interests, such as investments, employment or contracting
  work, outside of the Project that may influence their work on the
  Project.
- Access to proprietary information of their employer that could
  potentially leak into their work with the Project.

All members of the Council and Committee shall disclose any conflict of
interest they may have. Members with a conflict of interest in a
particular issue may participate in Council discussions on that issue,
but must recuse themselves from voting on the issue.
